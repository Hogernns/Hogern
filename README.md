# Hogern (mulitplayer version)
# ---PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING---
Hogern is a game I made using out of the box ideas for levels in the game.
# How to play and how the game works
How to get started
1. Pick a username
2. Join or create a party under your username. It is optional to pick a password.
3. Have your friends join your party, ready up, and get into the game.

How to play

Once in the game, your game encounters a bug, your game will crash. Or get very laggy at times. Don't worry though, this is all apart of the game. After your game crashes once you log back in you can create a new party with your friends and find a new level unlocked. This is the game progression. Thats all you need to know.... Have fun!
